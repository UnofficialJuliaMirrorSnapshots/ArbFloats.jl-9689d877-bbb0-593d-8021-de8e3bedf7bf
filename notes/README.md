#####This is for Julia v0.5.

####Appropriateness 

Preferred for extending the precision of floating point computations from 64 bits [17 digits] up to 512 bits [150 digits].  Recommended for use where elementary or special functions are evaluated to obtain results with up to 250 digits [800 bits].

##### What you see obtains with one single application of a trigonometric or ainverse trignonmetric function is the best valuation possible in this sense:  is more accurate while being least misleading result is as the displayed _name_ for that numerical quantity which most perfectingly balances desire for accuracy with distaste for misunderstanding or avoidance of the incorrect, the less competent, and other introducable antiutility.

A single appplication of e.g. log(), sin(), acosh(), zeta() to a finite, normal domain value returns  finite normal codomain value.
